<p>Hey,</p>
<p>We have a bunch of new features released in Seamless Cloud:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Templates (https://app.seamlesscloud.io/templates). Now you can find a template for your use case and create a Job based on it in one click.
  We're going to expand the library of Templates rapidly in the near future.</li>
  <li>Job Parameters. Are you familiar with the concept of environment variables?
      If you are not, this article explains it well https://medium.com/chingu/an-introduction-to-environment-variables-and-how-to-use-them-f602f66d15fa.
      So, Job Parameters are basically environment variables for the Job. You can find them on the Job page.</li>
  <li>You can do way more in WEB UI. Now for simple tasks you don't have to use the CLI - you can do them right in the browser.
  For example, you can now delete the job, edit its schedule and even edit the source code - all in the WEB UI.
  You can still use CLI if you're a more advanced user and need more flexibility.</li>
</ul>
