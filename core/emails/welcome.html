<p>Hey, nice to meet you. My name is Andrey, and I'm one of the creators of the Seamless Cloud.</p>
<p>I am glad that you decided to try the product. We created it to help you automate your routine tasks with ease and spend more time living and doing what you love.</p>
<p>Here is a Quick Start Guide - https://app.seamlesscloud.io/guide. You can also explore examples of Seamless Jobs (https://github.com/seamless-io/templates) and use them as templates for your own.
<p>Since we are in beta right now, there are some limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By default, you can upload up to two jobs; if you want to extend the number of jobs - get in touch with us, and we will figure it out.</li>
  <li>You can only write code in Python v3.6 or higher.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you will enjoy using Seamless Cloud!</p>
